# LUMS-MarketPlace
Product Perspective
In LUMS and many other universities, students and faculty often have a need to buy and sell second-hand products, but the current channels for doing so, such as discussion forums or social media groups, can be cluttered and difficult to navigate. That's how we got the idea and proposed the creation of a University Based Thrift Store web app named (Lums MarketPlace.Lums), which would provide a dedicated platform for these transactions and offer a more user-friendly experience.
This app can be counted as the member of e-commerce softwareâ€™s product family and more precisely a LUMS exclusive Mini OLX or DEPOP app. The main purpose of having a university-based exclusive thrift store is to create trust among sellers and buyers of the same institutions and to declutter the discussion forums from these buying selling posts.
Like the OLX, our app will have users interacting in a way that everyone can browse through the product catalogs, and anyone can post his/her product using sell now function of our app. Moreover, our app would have a search function that allows users to easily find products based on tags included in the product descriptions. This would help to streamline the process of finding what they are looking for and reduce clutter. The Lums MarketPlace would not only provide a convenient platform for buying and selling second-hand products, but it would also promote sustainability by encouraging the reuse of products and reducing waste. This app would be a win-win for both buyers and sellers, providing a low-cost alternative for obtaining goods and making it easier for people to sell items they no longer need.
We believe that the Lums MarketPlace has the potential to greatly benefit university communities and help to create a more sustainable and efficient system for buying and selling second-hand products.
